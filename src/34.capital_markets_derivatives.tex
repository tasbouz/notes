\section{Derivatives}

\bd[Derivative]
A \textbf{derivative} is a contract for a future transaction of an underlying asset between two parties, the buyer and
the seller, which derives its value from the performance of the underlying asset.
\ed

\bd[Underlying Asset]
The \textbf{underlying asset} is any asset that has a value which can be measured, from which a derivative derives its
value from.
\ed

\be
The underlying asset can be really anything. From a financial asset such as a stock, an index, or a rate, to a
non-financial asset such as a piece of real estate or a car, or even a non-physical asset, such as a weather condition,
or the outcome of a sports game.
\ee

In the derivatives jargon, the buyer of the derivative is referred to as the ``long'' position and the seller is
referred to as the ``short'' position.

\bd[Long / Short Position]
The party that agrees to buy the asset is said to be in a \textbf{long position}, while the party that agrees to sell
the asset is said to be in a \textbf{short position}.
\ed

\bd[Derivative Market]
A \textbf{derivative market} is a submarket of capital markets where people trade derivatives.
\ed

The derivatives markets are much bigger than the stock market when measured in terms of underlying assets. Depending
on the market being traded derivatives can be either ``exchange-traded'' or ``over-the-counter''.

\bd[Exchange-Traded Derivative]
An \textbf{exchange-traded derivative} is a standardized derivative that is traded on a regulated derivative exchange.
\ed

\bd[Derivative Exchange]
A \textbf{derivative exchange} is a central derivative market where people can trade standardized exchange-traded
derivatives defined by the exchange.
\ed

Once two traders have agreed to a trade offered by an exchange, it is handled by the clearing house.

\bd[Clearing House]
A \textbf{clearing house} is an organization that facilitates tradings between two parties and manages the risks.
\ed

The advantage of a clearing house is that traders do not have to worry about the creditworthiness of the people they
are trading with. The clearing house takes care of credit risk by requiring each of the two traders to deposit funds
to ensure that they will live up to their obligations. \v

Traditionally exchange-traded derivatives traders used to physically meet on the floor of the exchange, shouting, and
using a complicated set of hand signals to indicate the trades they would like to carry out. Exchanges have largely
replaced this system by electronic trading which involves the use of algorithms to initiate trades, often without human
intervention, and has become an important feature of derivatives markets.

\bd[Over-The-Counter Derivative]
An \textbf{over-the-counter (OTC) derivative} is a derivative that is traded off-exchange.
\ed

\bd[Over-The-Counter Market]
An \textbf{over-the-counter (OTC) market} is a decentralized derivative market where trading of OTC derivatives is done
directly between two parties without a central exchange or clearing house.
\ed

Banks, other large financial institutions, fund managers, and corporations are the main participants in OTC derivatives
markets. Credit risk has traditionally been a feature of OTC derivatives markets. In an attempt to reduce credit risk,
the OTC market has borrowed some ideas from exchange-traded markets. Once an OTC trade has been agreed, the two parties
can either present it to a central counterparty, which is like an exchange clearing house, or clear the trade
bilaterally where the two parties have usually signed an agreement covering all their transactions with each other. \v

While OTC markets were largely unregulated, following the financial crisis of 2008 we have seen the development of
many new regulations affecting the operation of OTC markets. The main objectives of the regulations are to improve
the transparency of OTC markets and reduce systemic risk. The OTC market in some respects is being forced to become
more like the exchange-traded market. \v

Both exchange-traded and OTC markets for derivatives are huge. The number of derivatives transactions per year in OTC
markets is smaller than in exchange-traded markets, but the average size of the transactions is much greater, making
the volume of business in OTC market much larger than in the exchange-traded one. \v

Derivatives markets have been outstandingly successful. The main reason is that they have attracted many different
types of traders and have a great deal of liquidity. When a trader wants to take one side of a contract, there is
usually no problem in finding someone who is prepared to take the other side. \v

In general, three broad categories of traders can be identified:
\bit
\item \textbf{Hedgers}: Use derivatives to reduce the risk that they face from potential future movements in a market
variable.
\item \textbf{Speculators}: Use derivatives to bet on the future direction of a market variable.
\item \textbf{Arbitrageurs}: Take offsetting positions in two or more instruments to lock in a profit.
\eit

\section{Futures / Forwards}

\bd[Future / Forward]
A \textbf{future} or \textbf{forward}\footnote{The main difference between a future and a forward is that a future is an
exchange-traded derivative while a forward is an OTC derivative. From now on we will be using the term ``future'' to
refer to both futures amd forwards.} is a derivative that obligates the buyer to buy and the seller to sell the
underlying asset for a specified price $K$ at a specified future date $T$.
\ed

\bd[Delivery Price / Future Price]
The specified price $K$ in a future is called the \textbf{delivery} or \textbf{future price}.
\ed

Future price, like any other price, is determined by the laws of supply and demand. If, at a particular time, more
traders wish to sell rather than buy, the price will go down. New buyers then enter the market so that a balance
between buyers and sellers is maintained. If more traders wish to buy rather than sell the price goes up. New
sellers then enter the market and a balance between buyers and sellers is maintained.

\bd[Delivery Date / Maturity Date]
The specified future date $T$ in a future is called the \textbf{delivery} or \textbf{maturity date}.
\ed

When developing a future, the exchange must specify in some detail the exact nature of the agreement between the two
parties. In particular, it must specify:
\bit
\item \textbf{The Asset}: Acceptable commodities or well-defined financial assets.
\item \textbf{The Contract Size}: The amount of the asset to be delivered per contract.
\item \textbf{Delivery Arrangements}: The delivery location, crucial for commodities with high transport costs.
\item \textbf{Delivery Months}: The delivery period during the month, varying by contract.
\item \textbf{Price Quotes}: How prices are quoted.
\item \textbf{Price \& Position Limits}: Daily price movement limits to prevent speculative excesses, and position
limits for speculators.
\eit

It is important to mention that the vast majority of futures contracts do not lead to the delivery of the underlying
asset. Instead, they are ``closed out'' early, prior to the delivery period specified in the contract. Nevertheless,
it is the possibility of eventual delivery that determines the futures price.

\bd[Closing Out]
\textbf{Closing out} a position means entering into the opposite trade to the original one.
\ed

Beside the future price, there is also the price of the underlying asset, which is called the ``spot price''.

\bd[Spot Price]
The \textbf{spot price} $S_t$ is the price of an asset for immediate delivery at time $t$.
\ed

Given the future price and the spot price, it is quite straightforward to determine the payoff for a long and a short
position in a future. More specifically, the payoff for a long position $P_{\text{long}}$ in a future on one unit of an
asset is:
\bse
P_{\text{long}} = S_T - K
\ese

where $S_T$ is the spot price of the asset at maturity of the contract. This is because the holder of the contract is
obligated to buy an asset worth $S_T$ for $K$. \v

Similarly, the payoff for a short position $P_{\text{short}}$ in a future on one unit of an asset is:
\bse
P_{\text{short}} = K - S_T
\ese

\vspace{5pt}
\fig{dv1}{0.56}

These payoffs can be positive or negative. Because it costs nothing to enter into a future contract, the payoff from
the contract is also the trader's total gain or loss from the contract. \v

As the delivery period for a futures contract is approached, the futures price converges to the spot price of the
underlying asset. When the delivery period is reached, the futures price equals, or is very close to, the spot price.
This is known as the ``convergence property'' of futures prices. If that was not the case, then traders could make
riskless profits by exploiting the difference between the futures price and the spot price as the delivery period
approaches.

\fig{dv2}{0.55}

\subsection{Margin Accounts}

If two traders get in touch with each other directly and agree to trade an asset in the future for a certain price,
there are obvious risks. One of the traders may regret the deal and try to back out. Alternatively, the trader
simply may not have the financial resources to honor the agreement. One of the key roles of the exchange is to
organize trading so that contract defaults are avoided. This is where ``margin accounts'' come in.

\bd[Margin Account]
A \textbf{margin account} is an account in which a trader must keep funds in to ensure that they will be able to meet
the obligations of a contract.
\ed

The whole purpose of the margining account is to ensure that funds are available to pay traders when they make a
profit. Overall the system has been very successful.

\bd[Initial Margin]
The amount that must be deposited in the margin account at the time the contract is entered into is known as the
\textbf{initial margin}.
\ed

At the end of each trading day, the margin account is adjusted to reflect the trader's gain or loss. This practice is
referred to as ``daily settlement'' or ``marking to market''.

\bd[Daily Settlement / Marking To Market]
\textbf{Daily settlement} or \textbf{marking to market} is the process of adjusting the margin account to reflect the
trader's gain or loss at the end of each trading day.
\ed

Daily settlement leads to funds flowing each day between traders with long positions and traders with short positions.
If the futures price increases from one day to the next, funds flow from traders with short positions to traders with
long positions. If the futures price decreases from one day to the next, funds flow in the opposite direction, from
traders with long positions to traders with short positions. This daily flow of funds between traders to reflect gains
and losses is known as ``variation margin''.

\bd[Variation Margin]
The amount that must be paid to the margin account to reflect the trader's gain or loss is called the \textbf{variation
margin}.
\ed

As it makes sense, variation margins change the balance in the margin account. Margin accounts have a minimum balance
that must be maintained at all times, known as the ``maintenance margin''.

\bd[Maintenance Margin]
The minimum amount that must be maintained in a margin account is called \textbf{maintenance margin}.
\ed

The maintenance margin is usually 75\% of the initial margin, however, both initial and maintenance margins are set
by the exchange clearing house and are determined by the variability of the price of the underlying asset and are
revised when necessary. As it makes sence, the higher the variability, the higher the margin levels. If the balance
in the margin account falls below the maintenance margin, due to the variation margin being negative, the trader
will receive a ``margin call'' from the exchange.

\bd[Margin Call]
A \textbf{margin call} is a demand for additional funds to be deposited in a margin account, when the balance in it
falls below the maintenance margin, to bring the balance up to the initial margin level.
\ed

The trader who receives a margin call is expected to top up the margin account to the initial margin level within a
short period of time. If the trader does not provide this variation margin, the broker closes out the position. On
the other hand, if the trader's contract increases in value, the balance in the margin account increases. The trader
is entitled to withdraw any balance in the margin account that is in excess of the initial margin.

\be
Here is a simple example of a margin account with an initial margin of \$12,000, and maintenance margin of \$9,000.
The daily gains represent the variation margins that are either added or subtracted from the margin account.
\fig{dv3}{0.4}

\section{Options}

\bd[Option]
An \textbf{option}\footnote{As with futures and forewards, options can be both exchange-traded and OTC derivatives. In
what follows we will be using the term ``option'' to refer to both exchange-traded and OTC options.} is a derivative
that gives the buyer the right to buy or sell, and the seller the obligation to sell or buy, an underlying asset for a
specified price $K$ at a specified future date $T$.
\ed

It should be emphasized that what distinguishes options from futures and forwards, is that an option gives the buyer
the right to buy or sell. The buyer does not have to exercise this right, if it is not advantageous to do so. For this
reason, in the context of options, the buyer is also referred to as the ``holder'' or the ``owner'' of the option. (In
what follows we will be using these terms interchangeably.) On the other hand, the seller of the option is obligated to
sell or buy the underlying asset if the buyer chooses to exercise the option. This is the reason why the seller of the
option is also referred to as the ``writer'' of the option. \v

Although, as we already said, the undrelying asset can be anything, in practice, the underlying asset is usually a
stock or a stock index. In what follows, we will be using the term option to refer to stock options, unless otherwise
specified. \v

\bd[Strike Price / Exercise Price]
The specified price $K$ in an option is called the \textbf{strike} or \textbf{exercise price}.
\ed

Strike prices are generally spaced 5 points apart for stocks, although for more expensive stocks, the striking prices
may be 10 points apart, while for less expensive stocks, they may be 2.5 points apart. However, these intervals are not
set in stone, since the exchange may alter them to improve depth and liquidity.

\be
A \$35 stock might, for example, have options with strike prices of \$30, \$35, and \$40, while a \$255 stock might
have one at \$250 and one at \$260. A cheaper stoke, say \$17, might have strikes at \$15, \$17.50, and \$20.
\ee

\bd[Expiration Date / Maturity]
The specified future date $T$ in an option is called the \textbf{expiration date} or \textbf{maturity}.
\ed

The expiration date is usually given as the month in which the option expires. The exact date of expiration is fixed
within each month, and it's the third Friday in the expiration month.

Based on if the option can be exercised only on the expiration date or at any time up to the expiration date, we
distinguish between ``European'' and ``American'' options.

\bd[European Option]
A \textbf{European option} is an option that can be exercised only on the expiration date.
\ed

\bd[American Option]
An \textbf{American option} is an option that can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date.
\ed

Note that the terms ``American'' and ``European'' do not refer to the location of the option or the exchange. Most of
the options that are traded on exchanges are American. European options are generally easier to analyze than American
options, and some of the properties of an American option are frequently deduced from those of its European counterpart.
\v

Based on if the holder has the right to buy or sell the underlying asset, we distinguish between ``call'' and ``put''
option types.

\bd[Call Option]
A \textbf{call option} is an option that gives the holder the right to buy an underlying asset at a specified future
date $T$ for a specified price $K$.
\ed

\bd[Put Option]
A \textbf{put option} is an option that gives the holder the right to sell an underlying asset at a specified future
date $T$ for a specified price $K$.
\ed

Hence, there are four types of participants in options markets:
\bit
\item Buyers of calls.
\item Sellers of calls.
\item Buyers of puts.
\item Sellers of puts.
\eit

The abovementioned four specifications: underlying asset, expiration date, strike price, and type, uniquely describe
any option contract.

\be
An option referred to as an \code{XYZ July 50 Call} is an option to buy (Call) the underlying stock (XYZ) for \$50
(50) per share. The option expires in July (July).
\ee

Given these four specifications, one can group options into ``classes'' and ``series''.

\bd[Class of Options]
A \textbf{class of options} is a group of options of any type (calls and puts) that have the same underlying asset,
expiration date, and strike price.
\ed

\bd[Series of Options]
A \textbf{series of options} is a group of options of any type (calls and puts) that have the same underlying asset and
expiration date, but different strike prices.
\ed

\bd[Opening Transaction]
An \textbf{opening transaction} is the initial transaction that creates a new position in an option.
\ed

There are two types of opening transactions: ``buy to open'' and ``sell to open''.

\bd[Buy To Open]
A \textbf{buy to open} transaction is an opening transaction that creates a new long position in an option.
\ed

In practice, for buy to open, one can either buy a call or a put option. The buyer of a call option is said to be
``bullish'' on the underlying asset, while the buyer of a put option is said to be ``bearish'' on the underlying asset.

\bd[Sell To Open]
A \textbf{sell to open} transaction is a transaction that creates a new short position in an option.
\ed

In practice, for sell to open, one can either sell a call or a put option. The seller of a call option is said to be
``bearish'' on the underlying asset, while the seller of a put option is said to be ``bullish'' on the underlying asset.

\bd[Closing Transaction]
A \textbf{closing transaction} is a transaction that closes an existing position in an option.
\ed

There are two types of closing transactions: ``buy to close'' and ``sell to close''.

\bd[Buy To Close]
A \textbf{buy to close} transaction is a closing transaction that closes an existing short position in an option.
\ed

In practice, for buy to close, the

\bd[Sell To Close]
A \textbf{sell to close} transaction is a closing transaction that closes an existing long position in an option.
\ed






An option is a ``wasting'' asset; that is, it has only an initial value that declines (or ``wastes'' away) as time
passes. It may even expire worthless, or the holder may have to exercise it in order to recover some value before
expiration. Of course, the holder may sell the option in the listed option market before expiration. An option is
also a security by itself, but it is a derivative security. The option is irrevocably linked to the underlying
stock; its price fluctuates as the price of the underlying stock rises or falls. Splits and stock dividends in the
underlying stock affect the terms of listed options, although cash dividends do not. The holder of a call does not
receive any cash dividends paid by the underlying stock.



Whereas it costs nothing to enter into a forward or futures contract, there is a cost to acquiring an option.

Another crucial difference is that forwards are settled at the end of their life, while futures are, as settled daily.

Many of the participants in futures markets are hedgers. Their aim is to use futures markets to reduce a particular
risk that they face. When one chooses to use futures markets to hedge a risk, the objective is often to take a
position that neutralizes the risk as far as possible.

\bd[Perfect Hedge]
A \textbf{perfect hedge} is a hedge that completely eliminates the risk.
\ed

Perfect hedges are rare. For the most part, therefore, a study of hedging using futures contracts is a study of the
ways in which hedges can be constructed so that they perform as close to perfectly as possible.

There are two main types of hedges: short hedges and long hedges.

\bd[Short Hedge]
A \textbf{short hedge} is a hedge that involves a short position in futures contracts.
\ed

A short hedge is appropriate when the hedger already owns an asset and expects to sell it at some time in the
future, or when an asset is not owned right now but will be owned and ready for sale at some time in the future.

\bd[Long Hedge]
A \textbf{long hedge} is a hedge that involves a long position in futures contracts.
\ed

The purpose of hedging is to reduce risk. There is no guarantee that the outcome with hedging will be better than the
outcome without hedging.

There is a fundamental difference between the use of forward contracts and options for hedging. Forward contracts
are designed to neutralize risk by fixing the price that the hedger will pay or receive for the underlying asset.
Option contracts, by contrast, provide insurance. They offer a way for investors to protect themselves against
adverse price movements in the future while still allowing them to benefit from favorable price movements. Unlike
forwards, options involve the payment of an up-front fee.

Futures and options are similar instruments for speculators in that they both provide a way in which a type of
leverage can be obtained. However, there is an important difference between the two. When a speculator uses futures,
the potential loss as well as the potential gain is very large. When options are purchased, no matter how bad things
get, the speculator's loss is limited to the amount paid for the options.

Derivatives are very versatile instruments.

It is this very versatility that can cause problems.b
