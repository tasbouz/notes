# notes
Theoretical [notes](https://github.com/tasbouz/notes/blob/master/theory/out/theory.pdf) I keep on scientific topics I am interested in.

## Part 1: Mathematics

For the first part of my notes on "Mathematics" I have used the amazing notes of [sreahw](https://github.com/sreahw) 
that you can find [here](https://github.com/sreahw/schuller-geometric), and [here](https://github.com/sreahw/Lecture_Notes_GR), 
and I arranged the code to fit my needs. I strongly advise you to read the actual notes since they are more complete, 
more detailed, and more in order with the lectures:

* [Geometrical Anatomy of Theoretical Physics by Frederic Schuller](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPH7f_7ZlzxTi6kS4vCmv4ZKm9u8g5yic)
* [International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015 by Frederic Schuller](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_)

## Part 2: Probability Theory & Statistics

For the second part on "Probability Theory & Statistics", the notes are based on a collection of various books I read, 
and lectures I watched and found useful.

Some books are the following:
